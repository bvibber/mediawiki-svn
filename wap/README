Wap Wikipedia.
--------------
This is an often quick and dirty Hack for wap.es.wikipedia.org
made by Purodha Blissenbach, http://ksh.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Purodha

It is based on hawpedia, http://hawpedia.mobi/
using the HAWHAW library, http://hawhaw.de/
Little attempts have been made to improve the existing code,
but some limitations were lifted and errors removed.


Necessary to do:
----------------
* /lang/es/tanslations.php
  - to be checked and translations corrected / completed.
* /lang/nds/*
  - to be checked and translations corrected / completed.
* /config.php
  - should likely be taylored.

Changes:
--------
+ Name changed from Hawpedia to Wikipedia
+ several texts adapted.
+ "spoken Wikipedia" switched off
+ square brackets surrounding links removed.
  (can be switched back on in config.php)
+ Wikipedia globe logo added to all non-wp-pages
  (currently 16x16px, 32x32px, 58x58px, 81x81px logos available,
  can be set in ./hawiki/hawiki_cfg.inc)
  + those page are laid out more equally.
+ language selection:
  + can ignore browsers language preference and always
    use default language as per setting in config.php
  + can extract language preference from subdomain name
    as per setting in config.php
+ all embedded html entities (&bull;, &Auml;, ...)
  are now correctly converted to Unicode.
+ "magic word" control elements (e.g. __TOC__)
  are always not treated as text and are removed.
+ images can be switched off in config.php
+ images inline with text working now.
+ image scaling:
  + uses width from wikicode if less than max permitted
    (max set in config.php to 128px)
  + some image types are always scaled so as to force
    them through type conversion.
+ image loading:
  + images are loaded directly from the wikipedia
    if possible
  + they may be coming from either the Wikipedia istself
    or Wikimedia commons.
  + on-the-fly conversion for image types not supported by
    WAP devices is done through new local /image.php
+ Template, parser function and constant expansion added.
  It uses the Special:ExpandTemplates interface, and
  can be switched off in config.php
+ Language es (spanish) added. (Few translations are incomplete)
+ Language nds (lower saxon) added. (Some incomplete translations)
+ Lanugage ksh (K�lsch/Ripuarian languages) added.
+ whatever I forgot to mention :-)


Open Issues:
------------
* Image exceeding the (unknown) file size restriction of
  target devices are not detected and may cause errors.
* Transparency in SVG and PNG images is not preserved
  during conversion to GIF format.
* Expanded templates loose their parser property of being
  treated as if at a line break when inserted into the
  wikitext as they are. Thus wiki syntax like == or {|
  may go undetected.


Nice to be done (not necessarily in this order):

Parser:
- some embedded html to be treated
- wiki table styntax to be treated.
- wikilinks having a name space must not be ignored.
  + localized name space names to be recognized.

Other:
- Opera: Unicode or document type problem.

Images:
- alignment?
  + can WAP2 have text float around images?
- show text associated with an image, if present.
- associate links to local WP image page with images. How?
