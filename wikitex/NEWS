          With  the  introduction  of XML-like tags, we have
     cleared a major hurdle towards integration with  Media-
     Wiki; next on the list, parameters of the form:

          <music tempo="80"></music>

     WikiTeX'  vulnerability  to  attack  must also be thor-
     oughly sounded.

          We're  refactoring WikiTeX from the ground  up  to
     implement tags of the form:

          <class [parm: value]>content</class>

     and  likely  of  an  external  parser; where a lex/yacc
     solution might  be attractive.  (Finite state  recogni-
     tion  is  probably  what  we're looking  for,  however,
     rather  than  look-ahead  left-to-right  parsing;  i.e.
     top-down recursive descent.)

          If  WikiTeX'  sum scope, on the other hand, resem-
     bles a glue-script with  regular-expression  grinding,1
     we  might   not need  to  look  past  Perl; PHP, in any
     case, just passes as lexer/parser: but we'd like  some-
     thing  more robust and, above all, to separate applica-
     tion from interface.
