  - javax/sound:
    - sampled:     stubs for javax.sound.sampled.*

- output:          files generated as part of the build
  - build:         built class files
    - debug:       debug build
    - release:     release build
  - dist:          resulting jar files
    - debug:       debug versions of all cortado .jars
    - release:     release versions of all cortado .jars
    - applets:     all applet jars
    - src:         source distributions


NOTES
-----
- from the ant build file, we should be able to:
  - make a tarball with all the source and build stuff:
    "ant dist" (done)
  - generate the separate jars
    "ant jar-jcraft ..."
  - build the examples
  - generate stripped and debug versions of the applets, with specific plugins
    included
    "ant applets" or "ant applet-ovt applet-mmjs"
    "ant applets-debug"

- the plan is to:
  - build com.fluendo.utils in a jar
  - build com.jcraft in a jar
  - build com.fluendo.jheora in a jar (relying on jcraft and utils jars)
  - build com.fluendo.jst in a jar (relying on utils)
  - build com.fluendo.plugin into a jar (all combined, relying on all above)

- FIXME: what to do with the examples ?
