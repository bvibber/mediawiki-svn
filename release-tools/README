== upgradeTest.py ==

Checks out MediaWiki branches from 1.2 on up, to test upgrading from a fresh
database at each schema level.

Doesn't test all possible scenarios, but should catch gross regressions.

Currently a bit hacking. Requires SVN, PHP, MySQL on localhost, root w/ blank
password, and available space for databases 'uptest12'...'uptest15' etc.

WILL EAT ANY SUCH NAMED DATABASES YOU HAVE. BEWARE.
