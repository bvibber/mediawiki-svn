Servmon is an automated server monitoring tool used on the Wikimedia servers.
It's only designed for our use, but you could probably use it elsewhere with
some work.  I may even fix bugs if you find them.

This is "Servmon II", a C++ rewrite of the old Python code.  It's currently
entirely unfinished and not useful.  If you want to help, please contact
