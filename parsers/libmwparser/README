To build you will first need to build and install antlr3 and the C
runtime from the git repository:

git://github.com/antlr/antlr.git

I have been using commit ab2a28bbcd5e4c214b1f7edaeb1b88176dc1f34a from
Fri Jul 23 15:11:41.

You will also need to apply the patch 'antlr.patch' to the C runtime.
The parser will not work without it.

The antlr patch contains these items:

* fix for incorrect initialization of 'charPositionInLine'.

* support for producing several tokens per lexer rule by using EMIT()
  and EMITNEW().

* support for using EMIT() and EMITNEW() in fragment lexer
  rules.

* support for taking back produced tokens.

* support for installing an action to be executed at the end of file.



To run the unit tests, run 'configure' followed by 'make' and 'make
check'.

There is a small test program 'tests/testtext' that can be used to
test.  Just give the filename of a file containing wikitext as a
command line argument.

To use libmwparser in an application, implement the MWLISTENER
interface defined in the file include/mwlistener.h.
