Purpose:
Regression testing of mediawiki and mediawiki extension modules.
Currently checks whether certain wikisyntax generates the expected (X)HTML.
In future, generic web requests might also be checked.

The test is performed by logging on to the configured wiki and creating a
new page with the specified wikisyntax, surrounded by (long) unique marker
strings.


Syntax:

(unix)
./wikiation_webtest.py [options]

(all os)
python wikiation_webtest.py [options]

Options are all GNU long form:

base operations (pick 1):

--pyfile <filename>
	Execute tests from a python file of the appropriate format (a
	list of Test objects)
	(see examples/example.py, test.py).
	Writes a brief report to stdout while testing.

--xmlfile <filename>
	Execute tests from an xml file (see examples/example.xml for format)
	Writes a brief report to stdout while testing.

--category
	Execute tests from a category on the configured wiki
	(default: [[Category:Automated tests]]).
	Will check each page in the category for <exttest></exttest> 
	tags, assemble a test-set, and execute it.

--category-and-write
	similar to --category above, however, if the <exttest> element is 
	followed by a <result>...</result> element ( note: <result/> 
	currently doesn't work), the contents of the result element will
	be replaced by a wikiformatted report on the test result.
	This is helpful on-wiki for people who like to have their
	tests and results on the same page. A separate element is used
	to reduce the odds of wikiation-webtest accidentally mangeling 
	the page.

--test
	A quick simple built-in test to check if everything is working ok
	(checks the {{SERVER}} flag). It should report a failure and a diff.
	Useful for checking if your configuration is ok.

--help

Other flags:

--dump-xml <filename>
--dump-py <filename>
	After concluding the test, save respectively xml or python to the 
	specified filename, in a format suitable for reading by --pyfile or
	--xmlfile respectively.
	
	Both filetypes also include the outcome of the test 
	(HTML), and an ascii diff of the outcome with the expected outcome. 

	In the case of --category or --category-and-write, the .py
	file also includes PageReference information (see:
	test.PageReference). Be aware that PageReference information
	is only accurate at the time it was generated. If anyone alters 
	the contents of the test category it may no longer be valid. 
	This might be a problem in your own programs.

	To prevent the above problems in wikiation_webtest,
	--pyfile and --xmlfile only use test information.
	PageReference information, (X)HTML results, and diffs are ignored.

--category-name <category name>
	Specify a different category to operate on. Just state the category name itself
	(To use [[Category:Foobar]], you just say  --category-name Foobar ). If the category
	name uses spaces or other strange characters, you may need to escape or
	quote it. If you want to use unicode strings, ensure your shell and term pass
	unicode correctly.
	By default, wikiation webtest operates on the category Automated tests
	(that is to say: [[Category:Automated tests]]).
