	  Refactor the XDR data packets to be based on data type rather
	  than metric type. Split the data packets into value packets and
	  metadata packets so that extra metadata can be passed between
	  gmonds and gmetad. Introduce the TITLE and GROUP metadata for a
	  metric. Introduce a new global directive that determines the
	  interval at which metadata packets will be sent. Not as necessary
	  for multicast mode since a request to send metadata can simply be
	  broadcast on the channel.

	  Workaround rev 1.11 of libmetrics.h. It turns out that sys/user.h
	  and rpc/rpc.h are incompatable on FreeBSD due to both leading
	  (through a tangled maze of #includes) to definitions of entierly
	  different struct pmap's. This hack causes sys/user.h's include of
	  vm/pmap.h to be mostly a no-op.

	* [r559] srclib/libmetrics/freebsd/metrics.c:
	  Many bug fixes and cleanups: - Make cpu_state act like get_netbw
	  and get new values only if called more than 1/2 second from the
	  last value update. This causing obviously weird results from the
	  CPU metrics on sparc64 (where the counters seem to be very
	  course) and bogus, but more subtlety broken results on other
	  architectures. This has always been broken. - Implement
	  cpu_intr_func (one line!) - Make the logic for handling bad
	  returns from sysctl make sense. It should never be triggered in
	  most cases, but at least this way it won't return bogus values
	  when it happens. - Prefer sysctlbyname() to sysctl(). It's much
	  easier to read. - Reduce the use of pointless temporary
	  variables. - Comment/white space fixes, include more comments of
	  metrics we are unlikely to actually implement and comments on
	  other rather bogus metrics, mostly memory related ones.

	  gmetad/type_hash.gperf, gmetad/xml_hash.c, gmetad/xml_hash.gperf:
	  The Subtree Gmetad
	  
	  This version of gmetad constructs a full DOM tree of the XML,
	  similarly to gmond. With this structure, it enables an
	  interactive mode where you can select XML subtrees and summary
	  views. This will help the speed of the webfrontend's meta,
	  cluster, and host views immensely, among other things.
	  
	  I have added a backwards-compatibility mode that will affect
	  version 2.5.0 behavior (no grids). The polling interval bug in
	  conf.c is also fixed and tested.
	  
	  This gmetad will still deliver the full tree on port 8651 (by
	  default), and listens for interactive requests on port 8652.

	  gmetad/xml_hash.c, gmetad/xml_hash.gperf:
	  The grid-aware patch.
	  
	  Gmetad now wraps its data sources in a GRID tag. Nested GRIDs are
	  allowed. The purpose for this new tag is to distribute the load
	  of keeping RRDs, which has been identified as a computation and
	  I/O bottleneck.
	  
	  New features: -Grid Composability (meta-meta*) -Can use hostnames
	  in trusted host declarations -Settable polling interval for
	  sources [1] -Debug command line option -Cleaner code for
	  rrd_helpers.c and others. -Keeps swap_total summary RRDs for swap
	  display on MEM graphs.
	  
	  [1] The polling interval is the time between XML pulls from a
	  data source. It is optional, with a default of 15sec as before.
	  Be aware that the RRDs rely on this value when deciding if a
	  primary data point (PDP) is "undefined". You should only change
	  this value if you are creating new RRDs. If the polling interval
	  is changed after the RRD files have been created, graphs in the
	  webfrontend will not display correctly. Perhaps this can be
	  changed in the future with a call to "rrdtune".
	  
	  This code has been tested on Linux only, and is not ready for
	  release until verified on other platforms.

	  gmond/metric.h:
	  The Cleanup Patch
	  
	  Bumped the version to 2.5.1. Added the cleanup thread that
	  enforces the DMAX attribute on HOSTS and METRICS. This means that
	  hosts and metrics can be timed out of the XML tree (and hashes)
	  as specified. The definition is:
	  
	  'A metric will be deleted DMAX seconds after it is received, and
	  DMAX=0 means eternal life.'
	  
	  Currently hosts and builtin metrics will NEVER be deleted,
	  however once this code is hammered (tested hard) this may change.
	  Gmetric, however, now has the ability to specify --dmax and it
	  will be enforced.
	  
	  Other various code-language cleanups have also been incorporated
	  by this patch.

	  Disk Metrics for Linux Patch.
	  
	  My contribution before the 2.5.0 test period. Added three disk
	  metrics for linux OSs: disk_total, disk_free, and part_max_used.
	  The first two should be self explanatory, the last one means "of
	  all local disk partitions on this node, the fullest one is x%
	  used." Matt suggested this as an early warning system for
	  sysadmins.
	  
	  Other new features in this patch include true support of the
	  LOCATION attribute in the HOST tag, the ability to specify
	  trusted hosts with DNS names as well as IP addresses, and the
	  get_first_interface() method to find a network interface to use.
	  During testing, I found some false negatives: interfaces that
	  said they were not "multicast enabled", but worked fine with
	  ganglia. Now, if we cannot find a multicast interface, we fall
	  back to any UP network interface other than loopback.
	  
	  Notes on disk metrics for other OSs. I have used a GNU lib file,
	  fsusage.c, to actually do the statfs() call to find the free/used
	  disk blocks, which should be relatively portable given the right
	  #defines. The only thing that is truly linux-only is getting the
	  list of currently mounted devices. The file mountlist.c from the
	  GNU fileutils package (which includes the df command), may help
	  shed some light on this query for various operating systems.

	* [r46] gmetric/gmetric.c, gmond/metric.h:
	  The Timestamp Type Patch. Added a timestamp type for boottime,
	  etc. The new type helps format metrics on the webpage, among
	  other things.
	  
	  Other changes include new OWNER, LATLONG attributes to the
	  CLUSTER tag. The values for these metrics are set in
	  /etc/gmond.conf. The OWNER attr ensures that the cluster will
	  have a unique name accross admin domains. The NAME/OWNER pair
	  should be unique for every cluster in the world. This helps for
	  grid management, and is required by Globus.
	  
	  The LATLONG attr specifies a cluster's location by its latitude
	  and longitude. It is not strictly necessary, but enables some
	  cool analysis and perhaps even a world map with clusters on it
	  for the webpage. I have chosen to use the DMS format like "N32.87
	  W117.22", which will achieve around a 1 mile accuracy.
	  
	  Smaller changes include renaming the units "KBs" to "KB", and
	  began work on adding a LOCATION attribute to the HOST tag in the
	  XML output.

2002-06-20 02:24  massie

	* [r9] configure.in, gmond/gmond.c:
	  Added patch submitted by Steve Wagner which (in his words)...
	  What I've changed:
	  
	  * The version number (2.4.1b1). * irix.c now works. :) * Some
	  autoconf monkeying: * Added SUPPORT_GEXEC preprocessor
	  definition. * Added --enable-gexec switch. This is overridden
	  later... * ... by the platform-specific section. AIX, IRIX,
	  Solaris, etc. all set SUPPORT_GEXEC to 0. * Had to change the
	  autoconf settings in dotconf to be friendly to alternative
	  compilers (such as IRIX cc, which does not speak -W). * Had to
	  change libganglia's net.h prototypes, which are
	  non-IRIX-cc-friendly.
