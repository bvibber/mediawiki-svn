== 1. Introduction ==

The Random Image extension adds a <randomimage> tag to the MediaWiki parser
which allows for randomisation of multimedia content on a page.

When the tag is rendered, a random image is selected from those uploaded and
inserted at the location of the tag. Users can select a custom size, float
and provide a caption for the resulting image.

== 2. Requirements ==

The Random Image extension should be compatible with MediaWiki 1.5 upwards,
including the 1.10alpha development version.

== 3. Installing the extension ==

To install the extension, place all extension files into a RandomImage
directory within your MediaWiki extensions/ directory, then edit
LocalSettings.php and add the following line

	require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/RandomImage/RandomImage.php" );

Installation can be verified through the Special:Version page on the wiki.

== 4. Inserting a random image ==

The tag supports two basic forms:
	
* Single, i.e. <randomimage />, which produces an image without a caption
* Container, i.e. <randomimage></randomimage>, where text inside the tags
  is used as a caption
  
In addition, both tags support two additional attributes; size and float.
The default size is the user's thumbnail size. Provide a numerical value
to override the size, e.g.

	<randomimage size="300" />
	
Float allows overriding the float direction. You can combine attributes as
with most normal HTML-style tags.

== 5. Caching ==

By default, the output is cached in the regular parser cache. This can be
advantageous on larger sites which need to use caching to reduce the effects
of load, however, it means that content is not 100% dynamic.

To disable the parser cache on pages which use the <randomimage> tag, set
$wgRandomImageNoCache = true; in LocalSettings.php (after the call to include
the extension file). This will affect all users, and might incur additional
overhead on pageviews.
