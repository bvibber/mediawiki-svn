MediaWiki OpenID extension

version 0.7.0
14 Sep 2007

This is the README file for the OpenID extension for MediaWiki
software. The extension is only useful if you've got a MediaWiki
installation; it can only be installed by the administrator of the site.

The extension lets users log in with an OpenID
(http://www.openid.net/) instead of a username and password. An OpenID
is a special URL that people can use to log in to a Web site. The
extension also lets users who have an account on the wiki log in to
other OpenID-aware Web sites with their wiki user page as their OpenID.

Typical uses:

* Single-signon between multiple affiliated wikis and other sites. We
  have 12 wikis that work together for Wikitravel, and users can login
  to different Wikitravel wikis with their home wiki account.
* Single-signon across the Internet. OpenID isn't that well known
  ''yet'', but theoretically someone could login to their OpenID
  identity server in the morning and not have to login to another site
  for the rest of the day.

This is an early version of the extension and it's almost sure to have
bugs. (Don't despair, though: this is running in production on
Wikitravel [http://wikitravel.org/], a fairly big MW installation.)
See the BUGS section below for info on how to report problems.

Patches for YADIS support and FileStore storage by Jonathan Daugherty
<cygnus@janrain.com>.

== Pre-requisites ==

This software has been tested in production with MediaWiki 1.10.x. It
may or may not work with earlier or later versions, but I'm interested
in making later versions work, and I'd be happy to make minor changes
to make older, unsupported versions work too.

The software depends on the OpenIDEnabled.com PHP library for OpenID,
which in turn depends on the OpenIDEnabled.com PHP library for YADIS.
At the time of this writing, info on installing these libraries was
available here:

	  http://www.openidenabled.com/php-openid/

The last version tested with is 1.2.3 and 2.0.0 rc2. There are also
some required extensions; see the OpenIDEnabled documentation for
details. This software has been tested with the gmp and curl PHP
extensions installed, and it's recommended that you install them, too.

Note that some versions of MediaWiki overwrite the PHP library path in
LocalSettings.php. You may need to add the path to your PHP library
directory to the $path variable, like "/usr/share/php" or
"/usr/local/share/php".

== Installation ==

To install, copy all the files in the archive you downloaded to the
OpenID subdirectory of the extensions subdirectory of your MediaWiki
installation. Note that the software depends on having its code all in
the "OpenID" sub-directory; naming it "OpenID-Test" or "newextension1"
or whatever won't work.

You must create a table in your MediaWiki database to hold the OpenID
URL mappings. The openid_table.sql script in this directory should do
the trick. Typically you do this using the mysql command-line client,
like so:

        mysql -h yourdbhost -u youradminuser -p yourwikidb < openid_table.sql

Version 0.3 and below used a different database structure that was
pretty inefficient. If you installed this extension before, you should
copy the optionToTable.php script to your MediaWiki "maintenance"
directory and run it from the command line. This will copy the OpenID
mappings from the user table to the new table (but it doesn't erase
the old data... just in case).

In your MediaWiki LocalSettings.php, add the following line some place
towards the bottom of the file:

	require_once("$IP/extensions/OpenID/OpenID.php");

Theoretically it should work out of the box, but you'll almost
definitely want to set the trust root and access controls (see
Configuration below).

When installing this installation on Windows, add the following line to
LocalSettings.php:

	define('Auth_OpenID_RAND_SOURCE', null);

=== Caching ===

The extension stores some semi-persistent data in the $wgMemc object.
Where that object stores its data is configured by $wgMainCacheType in
LocalSettings.php. Often this is set at installation time by the
MediaWiki configuration script.

Typically for big wiki sites $wgMemc is a front-end for memcached
(http://www.danga.com/memcached/), so $wgMainCacheType =
CACHE_MEMCACHED.

For smaller sites, $wgMemc typically uses eAccelerator to do both data
caching and bytecode caching. In this case, $wgMainCacheType =
CACHE_ACCEL.

In case you don't have either installed, try $wgMainCacheType =
CACHE_ANYTHING. There's usually some fallback mechanism to store this
data for you.

If none of that works, you can use a filesystem-based storage; see the
Configuration options below.

== Logging in using OpenID ==

To log in to the wiki using an OpenID, go to the Special:OpenIDLogin
page on the wiki. Add the OpenID identity URL to the login box, and
click "Verify".

This ''should'' take you to the OpenID server for your identity, where
you can either log in (if you're not already) or approve allowing the
wiki to use your OpenID for logging in. If the OpenID server supports
the Simple Registration Extension ('sreg'), it may also ask you
whether to share personal information like your preferred nickname,
real name, email address, etc. Choose as you wish.

Once you're logged in to your OpenID server, and you've finished
approving the login, you should return to the wiki from whence you
came automatically.

Every user who logs in with an OpenID identity for the first time will
be assigned a "fake" username in the local wiki. (This just makes
things work better.)

If you've allowed your nickname to be passed to the wiki, and it's not
already taken, and it's a legal MediaWiki user name, then it should
use that for your login automatically.

If not, the extension will try to make up some good candidate
usernames for you and present you with a choice. If you don't like any
of them, you can make up your own.

After you're logged in, you can edit, read, write, and do all the
other things that MediaWiki users do. Since you've got a "real"
account, you'll also have a home page and a message page and such. It
should also be possible to assign extra permissions ('sysop',
'bureaucrat') to the account. You can log out as normal.

To log back in, use the OpenIDLogin page again. Don't try to login
using the regular login page, since it won't work.

You can log in with an Interwiki abbreviation of an URL right now, but
that's experimental and may disappear in later versions. Don't fall in
love with this convenient, useful feature. You may get hurt.

== Using a MediaWiki account as an OpenID ==

To log in to other sites with your MediaWiki account, your OpenID
identity URL is the full URL of your MediaWiki user page. So, for
example, the author's identity URL is:

	 http://wikitravel.org/en/User:Evan

When you use this OpenID with another site, logging in should take you
to the wiki site. You may need to enter your password if you're not
already logged in.

You'll then be asked if you want to let the other site log you in, and
if you want the MediaWiki wiki to share your personal information
(nickname, email, full name, language) with the other site. Choose
what feels comfortable to you. For some sites, you may not be asked;
see Configuration below.

Once you've finished deciding, the other site will finish the login.

You can't log in through OpenID on the same server. You can't use the
user page for a fake account created for an OpenID login as an OpenID
itself.

== Configuration ==

The administrator can configure these variables in the
LocalSettings.php file. Please read carefully.

* $wgTrustRoot -- This is an URL that identifies your site to OpenID
  servers. Typically, it's the "root" url of the site, like
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/" or "http://wikitravel.org/it/". If this is
  not set, the software will make a half-hearted guess, but it's not
  very good and you should probably just set it.

* $wgOpenIDConsumerDenyByDefault -- The administrator can decide which
  OpenIDs are allowed to login to their server. If this flag is
  true, only those OpenIDs that match one of the $wgOpenIDConsumerAllow
  and not one of the $wgOpenIDConsumerDeny patterns will be allowed to
  log in. If it is false, all OpenIDs are allowed to log in, unless
  they are matched by an $wgOpenIDConsumerDeny pattern and not an
  $wgOpenIDConsumerAllow. Typically you'll set this to true for
  testing and then false for general use.

* $wgOpenIDConsumerAllow -- an array of regular expressions that match
  OpenIDs you want to allow to log in. For example,
  "@^(http://)?wikitravel.org/@" will allow OpenIDs from the Wikitravel
  domain.

* $wgOpenIDConsumerDeny -- an array of regular expressions that match
  OpenIDs you want to deny access to. This is mostly useful for
  servers that are known to be bad. Example: "#^(http://)?example.com/#".

* $wgOpenIDServerForceAllowTrust -- an array of regular expressions
  that match trust roots that you want to skip trust checks for when
  the user logs in from those sites. A typical example would be a
  closely federated cluster of sites (like Wikimedia, Wikia, or
  Wikitravel) where the personal data is available to the trusting
  server ''anyways''. Be very careful using this across organizational
  boundaries.

* $wgOpenIDConsumerStoreType and $wgOpenIDServerStoreType -- strings
  denoting the type of storage to be used to store OpenID assocation
  data when acting as an OpenID relying party (consumer) and server,
  respectively. Valid values are "file" and "memc".  If the value for
  one or both is "file", $wgOpenIDConsumerStorePath or
  $wgOpenIDServerStorePath must be set, respectively (see below).  If
  either of these variables is set to an invalid value, an error page
  will be displayed. The default is "memc", unless the main cache is
  set to CACHE_NONE (default for MW), in which case it is "file".

* $wgOpenIDConsumerStorePath and $wgOpenIDServerStorePath -- strings
  specifying the paths where OpenID assocation data should be stored
  when acting as a relying party (consumer) or server, respectively.
  Each of these need only be set if the store type settings (above)
  are set to "file", respectively.  These strings, if both are set,
  MUST NOT be equal. If the store type is "file", the default here is
  "/tmp/$wgDBname/openidconsumer/" and "/tmp/$wgDBname/openidserver/"
  respectively. The path will be automatically created if it doesn't
  exist at runtime.

* $wgHideOpenIDLoginLink -- boolean that says whether or not to hide
  the OpenID login link in the personal URLs. Typically you'd use this
  if you've already got some other method for showing the OpenID login
  link, like in your skin. Note that it will *not* prevent login if
  the user navigates to Special:OpenIDLogin directly; it's simply
  cosmetic. This is mostly a backwards-compatibility option.
  
* $wgOpenIDLoginLogoUrl -- Url of the OpenID login logo. Defaults to
  'http://www.openid.net/login-bg.gif', but you may want to move it to
  a local URL, or an URL on a CDN, if that kind of thing floats your
  boat.

* $wgOpenIDShowUrlOnUserPage -- whether to show the OpenID identity URL
  on a user's home page. Possible values are 'always', 'never', or 'user' 
  (lets the user decide). Default is 'user'.

== Skins ==

If you are customizing a skin, and you want to show the OpenID
identity for a user (say, on their user page), use the function
OpenIDGetUserUrl($user). It takes a User object (not a name or an id!)
and returns the user's OpenID identity if it exists, or null if it
doesn't.

== Translation ==

The user interface strings for this extension are configurable through
the same Special:Allmessages page as MediaWiki itself. They all start
with "openid", and they're no more or less cryptic than MediaWiki's.

== OpenID services ==

These are some of the OpenID services I tested this extension with;
all have free signup for identities if you want to test, too.

* http://www.myopenid.com/ -- uses Simple Registration Extension
* http://getopenid.com/
* http://www.typekey.com/
* http://www.claimid.com/
* http://pip.verisignlabs.com/

== Bugs and enhancements ==

Bugs or feature requests can be sent to the author at
evan@wikitravel.org. The TODO file in this distribution has stuff I
think needs to be todone; + marks show things I've already done, and -
shows things that are yet to be done.

The big changes for the future:

* Snazzier UI -- better HTML, sexier forms
* Configure some stuff through Special:Preferences
* Auto-login if you've logged in before with an OpenID, and are logged
  into that account now

Probably a ways down the line:

* Allow delegation
